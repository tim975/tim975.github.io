# Weeknotes 1.2

Changed my Twitter handle to the [disemvowelled approximation of my real name](http://twitter.com/tmhwrd) that I also use on Instagram. My previous handle was derived from a blog I stopped keeping *twelve years ago*, so a change was overdue. I haven’t been looking at Twitter much the past few weeks. As a sentient resident of Earth I understand how important the US elections are, but the discourse around them is exhausting. Add the coronavirus and Twitter can be, in the vernacular, a hellsite. But on the upside, ignoring Twitter has left me more time to read.

Which I haven’t been doing much of, either. Picked a great time to start blogging: welcome to my site, I’m not interested in anything! That’s not true, I’m interested in 1990s guitar music and sugar-free energy drinks. Tired of forcing my unwilling eyes to traverse harsh expanses of ink-covered paper, I turned to audio, and have been enjoying Tom Cox’s [21st Century Yokel](http://tom-cox.com/books/21st-century-yokel/), as read by the author.

Attended the (fingers crossed) final outpatient appointment for a chronic ailment I’ve been dealing with for five or six years. Dozens of examinations, an MRI, and three surgeries under general anaesthetic later, the doctors and I have agreed that things are “pretty much ok”, and I have been discharged - or “released to the community”, as the doctor put it. Hope I get a lenient parole officer.

Rudy, our surprisingly loveable goldfish, died on Tuesday. Now one of our two remaining fish (danios named Biggie and Tupac) is unwell. Once the danios wiggle off this mortal coil that’ll be the end of our fish keeping for the time being. It’s too stressful.
