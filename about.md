# About

Hi, I’m Tim Howard, occasional writer, habitual flâneur (ie. I don’t have a driver’s license and sometimes the bus is cancelled), book reader, and music enthusiast. I divide my time between Melbourne, Australia,  and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tmhwrd/). I'm also on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tmhwrd).
