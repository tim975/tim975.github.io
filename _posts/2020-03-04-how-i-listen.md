# How I listen

[How are you listening in 2020?](https://disquiet.com/2020/02/22/how-we-listen/)

I’m all about physical media, having recently put together a modest set-up that allows me, for the first time in years, to play CDs and records. I love records, because of course I do - I’m a middle-aged arts graduate. But I also love CDs, which I admit are probably the least romantic physical media, but I grew up with them so they have a special allure. 

Inevitably, I use Spotify a lot. There’s no getting around how convenient it is. One change I have made recently is turning off autoplay, so that when an album runs its course I have to think about what I’d like to hear next, rather than letting Spotify decide for me. I’m also making an effort to buy things that I like, when I can afford to, especially from small labels and independent artists. 

Radio was a massive part of my listening life as a child and adolescent but it hasn’t had much room in my adult life. Over the past year, though, I’ve taken to listening to [Soma FM](https://somafm.com/), and to the radio mainstay of my youth, Melbourne’s [RRR](https://www.rrr.org.au/). I’m also hooked on the gleeful randomness and high-level pop geekery of KFAI Minneapolis’s [Crap From the Past](https://www.kfai.org/program/crapfromthepast/). CFTP is an exemplar of digital conservation, with 27 years of shows available at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/crapfromthepast).
