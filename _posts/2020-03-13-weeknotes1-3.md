# Weeknotes 1.3

Not much happening, only the impending shutdown of society in the face of a viral pandemic. As I write, Norway has joined the list of countries that have entered “lockdown”. Australia is presumably not far behind, but we’re yet to hear any specifics. Frightening times.

As is only natural, people are talking about the books they’ll be reading while they’re not allowed to do much else. [Emma Townshend](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9joelLg-AC/?igshid=1t05r7rc11jjc) unearthed art historian Bernard Berenson’s “One Year’s Reading for Fun”, which he wrote while housebound in Italy in 1942. (Berenson was an American Jew, his safety dependent upon the largesse of the Italian government.) I have only read his notes through January (the book is available on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/oneyearsreadingf009234mbp/page/n13/mode/2up)) but so far “for fun” Berenson has read Herodotus (in Greek), Bury’s *Greek Historians*, various French and German historians (in the original languages), Churchill’s book about the 1st Duke of Marlborough, Shirer’s *Berlin Diary*,and portions of *Mein Kampf*. I thought I was doing quite well last night when I read twenty pages of *The Master of Petersburg* before I went back to refreshing Twitter every five seconds.

Fish update: Biggie, the larger of our two danios, died last weekend. The sole survivor, Tupac, continues in rude health, and doesn’t appear concerned about reprisals.

**Record of the week:** I’m Talking was formed by [Essendon Airport](https://www.tim-howard.com/2020/03/10/essendonairport.html) veterans Robert Goodge, Ian Cox, and Barbara Hogarth, with vocalists Kate Ceberano and Zan Abeyratne (whose twin, Sherine, was in another left-field mid-80s pop group, Big Pig.) The group’s only full-length studio album, *Bear Witness*, is a superb collection of smooth, funky, 80s art pop. Abeyratne has a lovely, soulful voice, and Ceberano - only nineteen when the album was recorded - is a force of nature.
