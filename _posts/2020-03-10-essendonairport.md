# Essendon Airport

I’ve been getting deep into [Chapter Music’s two releases](https://chaptermusic.com/artist/essendon-airport/) compiling the output of Melbourne post-punk/minimal wave band Essendon Airport. (“We drew up a list of names and it was absolutely the most appalling.”)

*Sonic Investigations of the Trivial* (2002) collects the 1979 EP of that title, some live tracks, and the *Talking to Cleopatra* single and b-side. The music is mostly instrumental, with founding members David Chesworth and Robert Goodge developing intricate minimalist figures over primitive drum machine beats. It’s not cold and precise, though - there’s a loose, almost swinging quality, and the tone is warm rather than forbidding.

*Palimpsest* (2011) features the 1981 album of that title, and a second disc of live and unreleased tracks. By the time Essendon Airport recorded *Palimpsest*, the band had become a four piece with the addition of drummer Paul Fletcher and saxophonist Ian Cox. Bassist Barbara Hogarth joined the group a short time later, and she is present on some of the live tracks.

This incarnation of Essendon Airport produced a wonderful kind of deconstructed funk music, creating insistent rhythms over which Cox describes boppish melodies and free jazz-inspired breathy squeals, while Chesworth offers occasional deadpan vocals. It’s incredibly enjoyable to listen to: you can really feel the pleasure the band took in creating these sounds.

Evidently this attitude carried over into Essendon Airport’s live shows. A 1980 live review printed in the *Sonic Investigations* booklet praises their “unique brand of humour... Chesworth’s quick wit combined with Goodge’s ballet-like movements provided an amazing combination of technical skill and wry humour.” I love a lot of post-punk and related music, but Essendon Airport are one of the few associated bands I could honestly describe as *fun*.
